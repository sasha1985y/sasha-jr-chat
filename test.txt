Bald spot!
Actually named Bob. You've probably heard about this character. Now you can experience his adventure! This mod brings a faithful remake of PZ's old tech demo for everyone to enjoy!

How does it work?
This mod adds a new "Challenge" that is actually a remake of the tech demo the developers released many years ago for the public. Play as Bob Smith, and survive the Apocalypse with your wife Kate!

Under Development
This mod is NOT ready yet. I decided to release it earlier to see if enough people would be interested in it for me to finish the project. This is an extremely complex mod, and I just don't have the time or resources to finish it right now.
For now, the mod will finish about 90% onto the demo. More content may be added soon.
