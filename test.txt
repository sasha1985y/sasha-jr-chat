In Buenos Aires, a deadly snowfall has covered the streets — if you're not properly covered... you'll die instantly.

Big thanks to this guy for helping with the coding — absolute legend.

A new option has been added to start with an outdoor outfit. You can choose the one you prefer by creating an open-world game and checking the sandbox options.

This mod includes deadly snow, not eternal snow, so for a full experience I suggest combining it with the Cryogenic Winter mod and enabling the eternal snow option.

If you take off even a single piece of clothing while it's snowing, you will die immediately — worn-out clothing counts too, so watch out for zombies...

If you're inside a building, you're safe. You may even find refuge in vehicles, as long as all windows and doors are closed. But remember to put your clothes back on before going outside!

With this mod, a new project starts, an PZ server inspired by the eternaut, needs funding
